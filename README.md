The total population of San Mateo County has been dynamic between 1990 and 2016.  Key events such as the dot.com bubble bursting around 2002, the housing foreclosure and subsequent recession 2008-2011 fueled changes, particularly in domestic migration.  Natural Increase (Births - Deaths) has been much less dynamic, although births are decreasing.  But during the tech boom there has been a steady increase in total popualtion, with the most significant component of that change being Net Domestic and Foreign Migration.  Between 2006 and 2016, San Mateo County population grew by 68,724 residents.  For comparison, the county only added a net 19,469 residents between 1996 and 2006.

While the number of foreign migrants has steadily increased in the past ten years, the aftermath of the home foreclosure crisis, increasing income inequality, rising rents, congested traffic and crowding may explain the exodus of domestic residents, with a spike in outgoing domestic migration seen in the latest census figures for 2016, particualrly for Santa Clara County.
